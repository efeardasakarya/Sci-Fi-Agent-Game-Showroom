# Sci-Fi-Agent-Game-Showroom
I am delighted to present to you the best mechanics I have developed since I started working with Unreal Engine (with a little bit of polish, of course). I have categorized these mechanics into four groups: Combat, Skills, Movement, and Interaction. Each of them is fully functional and ready to be implemented in a game.

I have carefully worked to ensure they operate as flawlessly as possible and are easy for players to understand. For the map, I aimed to create a futuristic and highly symmetrical environment, both in terms of the character’s appearance and the chosen genre.

I would greatly appreciate your feedback on the mechanics, map design, lighting, materials, and other aspects. Hope you have fun!
